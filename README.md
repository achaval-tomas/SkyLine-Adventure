# SkyLine-Adventure
My first 2D platformer game in C++ using SDL and related libraries.

Code might not be the best, this was my first ever project in C++.

The game is Speedrun oriented. The goal is to Collect all coins and get to the finish platform alive as fast as possible. There are 3 levels of difficulty and 2 cities to be played in.

Some gameplay:
